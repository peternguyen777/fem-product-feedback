The Product Feedback application is a Reddit-like forum allowing dev teams to receive community feedback for their products. Feedback suggestions are able to be made anonymously and form threads to which other users can reply and upvote. These changes can be actioned by the administrator and integrated into a live roadmap allowing community transparency for future product upgrades.

For the application front-end, NextJS is used with Tailwind CSS for responsive styling. For the back-end, a relational database is employed for the site's feedback, comments, upvotes and users to be inter-connected. Supabase's PostgreSQL database is used with Apollo Client/GraphQL for querying and mutating data.

The application is currently as a demo and you are automatically logged in as administrator. See deployment to test our features.
